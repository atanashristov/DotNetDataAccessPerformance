This project compares the performance of different data access methods for .NET such as plain ADO.NET, Entity Framework, NHibernate and Drapper.

A simple CRUD interface is implemented using different ORMs and unit tests are executed to determine how long it takes to execute them.

You will need to use the Chinook database for SQL Server, see http://chinookdatabase.codeplex.com/.
